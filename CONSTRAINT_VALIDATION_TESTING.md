# Constraint Validation Gate - Testing Guide

## Overview
The Constraint Validation Gate prevents Phase 0 from scoring skills highly when their power-up claims contradict their own constraints. This document provides test scenarios to validate the implementation.

## Bug Fix: YAML Constraint Extraction

### The Problem
Initial implementation only searched description text for constraints, missing the primary source: YAML metadata fields.

**Original Bug:**
```
Input: Skill with metadata.constraints: "Cannot access live data"
Result: "‚úì No constraints found - analysis valid"
Outcome: FALSE POSITIVE (8/10 score when should be 2/10)
```

### The Fix
Updated `extractConstraints()` to use multi-source extraction:

1. **Primary Source**: Parse YAML frontmatter for `constraints:` field (top-level or nested in metadata)
2. **Secondary Source**: Search description text for constraint keywords
3. **Combine & Deduplicate**: Merge constraints from both sources

**After Fix:**
```
Input: Skill with metadata.constraints: "Cannot access live data"
Result: "‚úì Found 1 constraint(s): Cannot access live data"
Outcome: CORRECT (contradictions detected, score adjusted)
```

### Implementation Details
- `extractYAMLConstraints()` - Parses YAML frontmatter using regex
- `extractTextConstraints()` - Searches text for constraint keywords
- `extractConstraints()` - Orchestrates both + deduplication
- Enhanced logging shows constraint sources and detection details

### Bug Fix: "Users Must" False Positives (P1)

**Problem:** The contradiction detector treated "users must" as a blocking pattern, causing false positives.

**Example False Positive:**
```yaml
metadata:
  constraints: "Users must provide their own API key for authentication"

Power-up claim: "provides API integration capabilities"
```
**Wrong Result:** CONTRADICTION ‚ùå (skill was penalized incorrectly)

**Fix:** Removed "users must" and "requires user" from contradiction blocking patterns. These are *requirements* (skill can do X if user provides Y), not *prohibitions* (skill cannot do X).

**Correct Logic:**
- **Prohibition** (blocks capability): "Cannot access", "No API", "No database"
- **Requirement** (capability exists, needs input): "Users must provide API key", "Requires user to run script"

After fix, only explicit prohibitions trigger contradictions.

## What Was Implemented

### New Functions (Lines 1531-1920)

1. **`extractYAMLConstraints(text)`** - Lines 1531-1575
   - **PRIMARY SOURCE**: Extracts constraints from YAML frontmatter
   - Parses YAML metadata for `constraints:` field (top-level or nested in metadata)
   - Handles both quoted and unquoted constraint strings
   - Returns array of constraint strings from YAML

2. **`extractTextConstraints(description)`** - Lines 1577-1630
   - **SECONDARY SOURCE**: Extracts constraints from description text
   - Looks for keywords: "Cannot", "No access to", "Users must", "Requires user", etc.
   - Cleans markdown formatting
   - Returns array of constraint strings from text

3. **`extractConstraints(description)`** - Lines 1632-1661
   - **MAIN ORCHESTRATOR**: Combines YAML and text constraint extraction
   - Calls extractYAMLConstraints() first (primary source)
   - Calls extractTextConstraints() second (supplementary)
   - Deduplicates constraints across sources
   - Returns complete array of all constraints found

2. **`extractPowerUpClaims(powerUpStatement)`** - Lines 1569-1625
   - Extracts claimed capabilities from power-up statement
   - Looks for markers: "providing", "enables", "performs", "executes", etc.
   - Identifies capability keywords: "web scraping", "real-time", "live data", "api calls", etc.
   - Returns array of claimed capabilities

3. **`validateConstraints(requirements, utilityAnalysis)`** - Lines 1627-1746
   - Main validation function that orchestrates constraint checking
   - Checks if power-up claims contradict skill's constraints
   - Recalculates score if contradictions found
   - Returns validation report with revised analysis

4. **`detectContradiction(claim, constraint)`** - Lines 1748-1799
   - Checks if a specific claim contradicts a constraint
   - Uses contradiction mapping and word-overlap detection
   - Returns true if contradiction detected

5. **`recalculateUtilityScore(originalScore, contradictionCount, validClaimsRatio)`** - Lines 1801-1815
   - Recalculates score based on contradictions
   - Penalty: -2 points per contradiction
   - Additional -4 points if <50% of claims are valid

6. **`categorizeUtilityScore(score)`** - Lines 1817-1824
   - Converts numeric score to category
   - 7-10: HIGH_UTILITY, 4-6: MEDIUM_UTILITY, 0-3: LOW_UTILITY

### Modified Functions

1. **`startGeneration()`** - Lines 2373-2397
   - Added constraint validation call after utility analysis
   - Validates claims against constraints before displaying results
   - Logs validation status and score adjustments
   - Passes validation result to showUtilityResults

2. **`showUtilityResults(analysis, validationResult)`** - Lines 1830-1908
   - Updated to accept optional validationResult parameter
   - Displays constraint validation report when contradictions found
   - Shows original vs revised scores
   - Lists contradicted claims and remaining valid claims

### New HTML Elements

1. **`constraintValidationReport`** - Line 977
   - Container div for displaying validation results
   - Dynamically populated when contradictions detected
   - Hidden when no contradictions

## How It Works

### Phase 0 Flow (New)

```
Extract Requirements (input description)
  ‚Üì
Analyze Utility (generate power-up claims)
  ‚Üì
CONSTRAINT VALIDATION GATE ‚Üê NEW
  ‚îú‚îÄ Extract constraints from description
  ‚îú‚îÄ Extract claims from power-up statement
  ‚îú‚îÄ Detect contradictions
  ‚îú‚îÄ If contradictions found:
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Remove false claims
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Recalculate utility score
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Update phase routing if needed
  ‚îî‚îÄ Log validation results
  ‚Üì
Show Utility Results (with validation report)
  ‚Üì
Route to Phase 2 or Problem Identifier
```

### Validation Logic

```javascript
For each power-up claim:
  For each constraint:
    If claim contradicts constraint:
      Mark as contradicted
      Record conflict

If contradictions found:
  Calculate penalty = contradictions √ó 2
  If valid_claims < 50%: penalty += 4
  New score = max(0, original_score - penalty)

  Update analysis with:
    - Revised score
    - Revised category
    - Revised routing
    - Updated power-up statement
```

data extraction, and real-time research capabilities.
```

**Expected Behavior:**

**Initial Utility Analysis:**
- Score: 8/10 (HIGH_UTILITY)
- Power-up: "This skill powers up Claude by: providing executable web scraping, automated data extraction, and real-time research capabilities"

**Constraint Validation (FIXED - Now extracts YAML constraints):**

‚ö†Ô∏è No valid power-up claims remain after constraint validation

Routing: Score dropped significantly - REDESIGN RECOMMENDED
```

**Verification:**

### Test 2: API Integration Skill (Users Must Provide Key - Should Pass)

**Input (with user requirement, not prohibition):**
```yaml
---
name: api-integration-helper
description: "API integration helper"
metadata:
  constraints: "Users must provide their own API keys. Requires user to configure authentication."
---

Helps integrate with external APIs by generating request templates and handling
authentication flows.
```

**Expected Behavior:**

**Initial Utility Analysis:**
- Score: 7/10 (HIGH_UTILITY)
- Power-up: "This skill powers up Claude by: providing API integration capabilities, generating authentication flows"

**Constraint Validation (After Fix):**
- Constraints found: 2
  1. "Users must provide their own API keys"
  2. "Requires user to configure authentication"
- Claims checked: 2
  1. "API integration capabilities" ‚Üí VALID (not blocked by "users must provide")
  2. "authentication flows" ‚Üí VALID (not blocked by "requires user to")
- Valid claims: 2/2 (100%)
- **No contradictions detected** ‚úÖ

**Revised Analysis:**
- Score: 7/10 (unchanged)
- Category: HIGH_UTILITY
- Routing: PROCEED

**Expected Logs:**
```
[INFO] Running constraint validation...
[INFO] ‚úì Found 2 constraint(s) - all claims validated
[INFO]   - "Users must provide their own API keys"
[INFO]   - "Requires user to configure authentication"
[SUCCESS] ‚úì Constraint validation passed: 2 claim(s) verified
```

**Verification:**
- [x] "Users must" not treated as blocking pattern
- [x] "Requires user to" not treated as blocking pattern
- [x] Score remains 7/10 (no false positive penalty)
- [x] Routing stays PROCEED
- [x] No contradiction warnings in logs

**Why This Passes:**
- "Users must provide API keys" = **REQUIREMENT** (skill CAN do API calls, needs user's key)
- "Cannot access APIs" = **PROHIBITION** (skill CANNOT do API calls at all)
- Only prohibitions trigger contradictions

## Error Handling

### Edge Cases

**Empty Description:**
- Input: Skill with no description
- Expected: No constraints found, validation skipped

**No Power-up Statement:**
- Input: Utility analysis fails to generate power-up
- Expected: No claims to validate, validation skipped

**Malformed Constraints:**
- Input: Partial or unclear constraint statements
- Expected: Extracted anyway, may not match claims (safe)

**Ambiguous Claims:**
- Input: Vague power-up like "helps with data"
- Expected: May not match contradiction patterns (safe)

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Complete** when:
1. Constraint extraction works for all keyword patterns
2. Claims extraction identifies capability statements
3. Contradiction detection catches all example patterns
4. Score recalculation follows penalty rules
5. Validation report displays correctly
6. Routing updates based on revised scores
7. Logs show validation status clearly
8. No false positives (valid skills not penalized)
9. No false negatives (contradictions caught)
10. Performance overhead < 200ms

---

## Debugging Tips

**If validation not triggering:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify constraint keywords in description
3. Check power-up statement format
4. Look for "Running constraint validation..." in logs

**If contradictions not detected:**
1. Verify contradiction patterns in `detectContradiction()`
2. Check claim extraction is finding capabilities
3. Test word-overlap logic
4. Add console.log in validation functions

**If score calculation wrong:**
1. Check penalty formula: contradictions √ó 2
2. Verify valid claims ratio calculation
3. Confirm additional penalty for <50% valid
4. Test Math.max(0, score - penalty)

**If UI not displaying report:**
1. Verify constraintValidationReport div exists
2. Check validationResult.hasContradictions is true
3. Ensure container.classList.remove('hidden') called
4. Inspect HTML for generated content

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Keyword-based Detection**: May miss contradictions phrased differently
2. **No Semantic Analysis**: Relies on word matching, not meaning
3. **English Only**: Constraint keywords are English-specific
4. **Client-side Only**: No server-side validation

---

## Future Enhancements

1. Add more contradiction patterns for edge cases
2. Support multi-language constraint detection
3. Use AI to detect semantic contradictions
4. Cache validation results for same descriptions
5. Allow manual override of validation results
6. Show "Why is this a contradiction?" explanations

# Skill Factory Codebase Analysis Report
**Diagnostic Mission: Context Isolation Problem**
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Analyst:** Claude Code

---

## Executive Summary

**CONFIRMED: Context isolation IS the root cause.**

The Skill Factory has a **critical architectural flaw** where each phase makes independent assumptions about Claude's capabilities instead of referencing shared, factual context. This causes:
- **Contradictory scoring** (Phase 0 scores high, Categorization caps it low)
- **False capability assumptions** (Phase 0 doesn't know Claude has web search)
- **Inconsistent decision-making** across phases

### Verdict
✅ **YES** - Context isolation is the root cause
- No centralized CLAUDE_CAPABILITIES document exists
- Each phase makes independent assumptions
- Assumptions differ across phases (contradictory)
- No validation that solutions match Claude's actual model

### MISSING From Flow

**CRITICAL OMISSION:** No Claude capabilities context flows between phases!

❌ **NOT PASSED:**
- Claude's web search capability (launched March 2025)
- Claude Code's bash execution capability
- Claude Code's file read/write capability
- Claude's actual tool access and limitations

Each phase reconstructs its own understanding of "what Claude can do" from scratch.

---

## Assumption Map

### Phase 0: Utility Analyzer (index.html:1356-1397)

**Location:** Line 1356
**Context Received:** `requirements` (from Phase 1)
**Claude Capabilities Context:** ❌ **NONE**

**Assumptions Made:**
```javascript
const prompt = `You are the Universal Utility Analyzer...

Evaluate this skill request using the three universal questions:

1. Can Claude already do this well from training data?
2. What specific value does this skill provide that Claude doesn't have?
   - Executable code solving hard problems?
   - Embedded domain data or algorithms?
   ...
```

**CRITICAL ISSUE:**
- Asks "Can Claude already do this?" but provides NO facts about what Claude CAN do
- No mention that Claude HAS web search capability
- No mention that Claude Code CAN execute bash commands
- No mention of ANY Claude capabilities

**Classification:**
- ❌ GUESS - Phase 0 must guess what Claude can/cannot do
- ❌ OUTDATED - If relying on training data, may have outdated info
- ❌ INCONSISTENT - Different from Categorization's knowledge

---

### Categorization Logic (index.html:1436-1512)

**Location:** Line 1436
**Context Received:** `skillInput`, `requirements`
**Claude Capabilities Context:** ✅ **EXPLICIT**

**Capabilities Facts Provided:**
```javascript
CRITICAL CAPABILITY FACTS (October 2025):
✓ Claude HAS web search capability (launched March 2025)
✓ Claude Code CAN execute bash commands locally
✓ Claude Code CAN read/write files
✓ Claude Code CAN run scripts and commands
```

**Examples Provided:**
- "web researcher" → PROCESSOR (Claude has web search) - Max 9/10
- "deploy runner" → EXECUTOR (Claude can't deploy to cloud) - Max 2/10

**Classification:**
- ✅ FACT - Has explicit capability facts dated October 2025
- ✅ ACCURATE - States correct capabilities
- ✅ EXAMPLES - Provides specific categorization examples

**THE PROBLEM:**
This context exists ONLY in Categorization, NOT in Phase 0!

---

### Problem Identifier Agent (index.html:1665-1784)

**Location:** Line 1665
**Context Received:** `requirements`, `utilityAnalysis`, `domainContext`
**Claude Capabilities Context:** ❌ **PARTIAL - BUT INCORRECT**

**What It Asks For:**
```javascript
2. CLAUDE CAPABILITY GAP (SPECIFIC TO ${domainContext.primary_domain.toUpperCase()})
   - What specifically can't Claude do well for ${domainContext.primary_domain}?
   - What would Claude need to do this?
```

**CRITICAL ISSUE:**
- Asks the LLM to identify "what Claude can't do"
- But provides NO factual baseline of what Claude CAN do
- LLM must guess Claude's capabilities to identify gaps
- This leads to suggestions that may be based on outdated/incorrect assumptions

**Classification:**
- ❌ GUESS - Agent must guess what Claude can/cannot do
- ❌ NO BASELINE - No facts provided about Claude's actual capabilities
- ❌ INCONSISTENT - Different understanding than Categorization

---

## Centralized Capabilities Document

### Search Results

**Query:** "CLAUDE_CAPABILITIES", "claude_capabilities", centralized capabilities document

**Result:** ❌ **NOT FOUND**

The ONLY place where Claude's capabilities are explicitly stated is:
- **File:** index.html
- **Lines:** 1494-1498
- **Context:** ONLY in the categorization prompt
- **Scope:** NOT shared with other phases

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// Line 1494-1498: ONLY location of capabilities facts
CRITICAL CAPABILITY FACTS (October 2025):
✓ Claude HAS web search capability (launched March 2025)
✓ Claude Code CAN execute bash commands locally
✓ Claude Code CAN read/write files
✓ Claude Code CAN run scripts and commands
```

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Capabilities ARE documented (in one place)
- ❌ NOT centralized in a shared constant/variable
- ❌ NOT referenced by Phase 0 (Utility Analyzer)
- ❌ NOT referenced by Problem Identifier
- ❌ NOT passed as context between phases

### Conclusion

**No centralized capabilities document exists.**

Each phase that needs Claude capabilities context must:
1. Either hardcode it (as Categorization does), or
2. Guess it (as Phase 0 and Problem Identifier do)

This is the **ROOT CAUSE** of the context isolation problem.

---

## Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0: Utility Analyzer

**Input Context:**
- `requirements` object (skill_name, description, features, etc.)
- ❌ NO Claude capabilities context

**Assumptions Made:**
- "Can Claude already do this well from training data?" (line 1365)
  - **Assumption:** LLM must guess what's in Claude's training data
  - **No Facts Provided:** About current Claude capabilities

**Facts Used:**
- None - relies entirely on LLM's internal knowledge

**Centralized Context Reference:**
- ❌ NO

**Decision Logic:**
- Scores 0-10 based on perceived utility
- HIGH if it thinks skill adds capability Claude lacks
- LOW if it thinks Claude can already do this
- **PROBLEM:** Without facts about Claude's capabilities, this is guesswork

**Example Decision Path (web-researcher):**
1. Sees "web researcher" request
2. Asks: "Can Claude already do this well?"
3. Without knowing Claude HAS web search → thinks "No, Claude needs this"
4. Scores HIGH (9/10) thinking it's a valuable new capability
5. **WRONG** - Claude already has web search!

---

### Categorization Logic

**Input Context:**
- `skillInput` (raw user input)
- `requirements` (extracted requirements)
- ✅ **Hardcoded Claude capabilities facts** (lines 1494-1498)

**Assumptions Made:**
- Uses explicit facts, not assumptions

**Facts Used:**
- Claude HAS web search capability (March 2025)
- Claude Code CAN execute bash commands
- Claude Code CAN read/write files
- Claude Code CAN run scripts

**Centralized Context Reference:**
- ❌ NO - Hardcoded in this prompt only

**Decision Logic:**
- Categorizes into: TEMPLATE, METHODOLOGY, KNOWLEDGE, PROCESSOR, EXECUTOR
- Sets max_utility_score based on category
- Uses capability facts to decide category
- If skill requires capability Claude doesn't have → EXECUTOR (max 2/10)
- If skill uses capability Claude has → PROCESSOR (max 9/10)

**Example Decision Path (web-researcher):**
1. Sees "web researcher" request
2. Checks: "Can Claude execute web research?"
3. Knows Claude HAS web search → "Yes"
4. Categorizes as PROCESSOR (max 9/10)
5. **CORRECT** categorization
6. **BUT:** If Phase 0 scored 9/10 and category max is 2/10 (EXECUTOR)
   - Caps score to 2/10
   - This only happens if categorization MISCLASSIFIES as EXECUTOR

**The Contradiction:**
- If LLM misinterprets and classifies as EXECUTOR despite examples
- Original score 9/10 → capped to 2/10
- User sees confusing score change

---

### Problem Identifier Agent

**Input Context:**
- `requirements`
- `utilityAnalysis`
- `domainContext` (primary_domain, practitioners, excluded_domains)
- ❌ NO Claude capabilities context

**Assumptions Made:**
- "What specifically can't Claude do well for ${domain}?" (line 1697)
- **Assumption:** LLM must figure out what Claude can/cannot do
- No baseline facts provided

**Facts Used:**
- Domain information (practitioners, excluded domains)
- Current utility score
- ❌ NO Claude capabilities facts

**Centralized Context Reference:**
- ❌ NO

**Decision Logic:**
- Identifies practitioner pain points in domain
- Identifies "Claude capability gap"
- Suggests redesigns that fill the gap
- **PROBLEM:** Without knowing Claude's actual capabilities, may suggest:
  - Solutions for capabilities Claude already has
  - Solutions for capabilities Claude cannot have

**Example Decision Path (web-research domain):**
1. Domain: "web research"
2. Asks: "What can't Claude do for web research?"
3. Without knowing Claude HAS web search → might think "Claude can't do web research"
4. Suggests: "Add web search capability"
5. **WRONG** - Claude already has this!

**Domain Pivoting Issue:**
- Has strong domain constraints (excluded_domains)
- But weak capability constraints (no Claude facts)
- May suggest in-domain solutions that contradict Claude's capabilities

---

## Missing Context

### What Information SHOULD Flow But Doesn't

#### 1. Claude's Actual Capabilities (CRITICAL)

**Should be available to:**
- Phase 0 (Utility Analyzer) ← **MISSING**
- Categorization ← **Has it (hardcoded)**
- Problem Identifier ← **MISSING**

**Should contain:**
```javascript
const CLAUDE_CAPABILITIES = {
  web_search: {
    available: true,
    launched: "March 2025",
    description: "Claude can search the web using WebSearch tool"
  },
  bash_execution: {
    available: true,
    context: "Claude Code environment only",
    description: "Can execute bash commands locally"
  },
  file_operations: {
    available: true,
    operations: ["read", "write", "edit"],
    description: "Can read/write files in local filesystem"
  },
  real_time_data: {
    available: false,
    constraints: "Cannot access live APIs, databases, or real-time streams",
    workaround: "Can provide frameworks/scripts for users to run"
  },
  external_systems: {
    available: false,
    constraints: "Cannot deploy to cloud, run CI/CD, access external infrastructure",
    workaround: "Can provide deployment scripts/configurations"
  }
}
```

**Current State:**
- ✅ Documented in Categorization prompt (lines 1494-1498)
- ❌ NOT available to Phase 0
- ❌ NOT available to Problem Identifier
- ❌ NOT in a shared, reusable format

#### 2. Skill Constraints (at correct pipeline stage)

**Current Behavior:**
- Constraint extraction runs at line 2998 (BEFORE skill generation)
- Extracts from `requirements.description` (user's raw input)
- Looks for YAML frontmatter in user input ← **WRONG**

**Problem:**
- User input rarely has YAML frontmatter
- Constraints are generated LATER in the skill (metadata generation, line 2685)
- Constraint validation runs BEFORE constraints exist!

**Should Flow:**
```
Phase 0 → categorization → skill generation (creates YAML + constraints)
                                    ↓
                          Constraint validation ← **Should happen HERE**
                                    ↓
                          Final validation before output
```

**Currently:**
```
Phase 0 → categorization → constraint validation (no constraints found!)
                                    ↓
                          Skill generation (creates constraints)
                                    ↓
                          Output (constraints never validated against power-up claims)
```

#### 3. Category Context to Phase 0

**Should Flow:**
```
Phase 0 ← category definitions (what makes a real power-up?)
          ↓
     Uses categories to inform scoring
```

**Currently:**
```
Phase 0 (scores without category knowledge)
    ↓
Categorization (may contradict Phase 0's assumptions)
    ↓
Cap score (confusing to user)
```

## Bug Traceability

### Bug 1: web-researcher 9/10 → 2/10 Scoring Discrepancy

**Location in Code:** index.html lines 2953-2966

**Trace Through Code:**

**Step 1: User Input**
```
User requests: "web-researcher skill"
```

**Step 2: Phase 0 Analysis (line 1352-1418)**
```javascript
const prompt = `You are the Universal Utility Analyzer...
1. Can Claude already do this well from training data?
2. What specific value does this skill provide that Claude doesn't have?
`
// ❌ NO mention that Claude HAS web search capability
```

**Assumption Made:**
- Phase 0 LLM sees "web researcher"
- Asks: "Can Claude already do web research?"
- **Without web search capability context** → assumes "No, Claude needs this capability"
- Scores: 9/10 (HIGH_UTILITY - thinking it's a new capability)

**Evidence:** Line 1365-1366
```javascript
1. Can Claude already do this well from training data?
2. What specific value does this skill provide that Claude doesn't have?
```
No facts provided about current capabilities (web search, bash, etc.)

**Step 3: Categorization (line 1420-1527)**
```javascript
const prompt = `Categorize this skill request...

CRITICAL CAPABILITY FACTS (October 2025):
✓ Claude HAS web search capability (launched March 2025)
...
Example: "web researcher" → PROCESSOR (Claude has web search)
`
```

**Correct Path:**
- Categorization sees "web researcher"
- Has EXPLICIT knowledge: "Claude HAS web search capability"
- Should categorize as: PROCESSOR (max 9/10)
- Example provided: "web researcher" → PROCESSOR

**Bug Scenario (if LLM misclassifies):**
- Despite examples, LLM might see "researcher" indicator
- Might interpret as requiring "external execution" or "automation"
- Misclassifies as: EXECUTOR (max 2/10)

**Step 4: Score Capping (line 2959-2966)**
```javascript
if (originalScore > categoryMaxUtility) {
  addLog(`⚠️ Applying category ceiling: ${originalScore}/10 → ${categoryMaxUtility}/10`);
  utilityAnalysis.utility_score = categoryMaxUtility; // 9 → 2
}
```

**Result:**
- Original score: 9/10 (from Phase 0)
- Category max: 2/10 (from EXECUTOR misclassification)
- **Capped to: 2/10**
- User sees: "Score dropped from 9 to 2" with no clear explanation

**Root Cause:**
1. **Primary:** Phase 0 lacks Claude capabilities context
   - Scores high because it thinks web research is a new capability
   - Doesn't know Claude already has web search
2. **Secondary:** Categorization may misclassify despite having correct context
   - LLM-based decision can be inconsistent
   - Even with explicit examples, might categorize incorrectly

**Based on FACTS or ASSUMPTIONS?**
- Phase 0: ❌ **ASSUMPTIONS** (no capability facts provided)
- Categorization: ✅ **FACTS** (has capability context, but LLM decision still variable)

**Evidence in Code:**
- Phase 0 prompt: Lines 1356-1397 (NO capability facts)
- Categorization prompt: Lines 1494-1498 (HAS capability facts)
- Score capping logic: Lines 2959-2966

---

### Bug 2: Constraint Extraction Showing "No Constraints Found"

**Location in Code:** index.html lines 1846-1976, called at line 2998

**Trace Through Code:**

**Step 1: When Constraint Validation Runs**
```javascript
// Line 2998 - BEFORE skill is generated
const validationResult = validateConstraints(requirements, utilityAnalysis);
```

**Timing Issue:**
- Runs at line 2998
- This is AFTER Phase 0 and categorization
- But BEFORE skill generation (which happens later if user proceeds)

**Step 2: What Data Is Available**
```javascript
// validateConstraints receives:
// - requirements.description (extracted from user input at line 1319)
// - utilityAnalysis.power_up_statement
```

**Step 3: Constraint Extraction Logic (line 1846-1890)**
```javascript
function extractYAMLConstraints(text) {
  // Find YAML frontmatter (between --- delimiters)
  const yamlMatch = text.match(/^---\s*\n([\s\S]*?)\n---/);
  if (!yamlMatch) {
    return constraints; // No YAML frontmatter found ← THIS PATH
  }

  // Look for "constraints:" in YAML
  const constraintsMatch = yamlText.match(/^\s*constraints:\s*["']?(.*?)["']?\s*$/m);
}
```

**Problem:**
- Looks for YAML frontmatter in `requirements.description`
- `requirements.description` is from user's raw input (line 1323-1337)
- User input: "I want a web-research skill" ← **No YAML!**
- No match found → returns empty array

**Step 4: Text-Based Constraint Extraction (line 1892-1945)**
```javascript
function extractTextConstraints(description) {
  const constraintKeywords = [
    'Cannot', 'cannot', 'Cannot access', 'No access to',
    'Does not', 'Limited to', 'Restricted', ...
  ];

  for (const line of lines) {
    for (const keyword of constraintKeywords) {
      if (trimmed.includes(keyword)) {
        constraints.push(cleaned);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Problem:**
- User input: "web-researcher skill" ← No constraint keywords
- No matches found → returns empty array

**Step 5: Result**
```javascript
// Line 3024
addLog('✓ No constraints found - analysis valid', 'success');
```

**Why Constraints Are Not Found:**

1. **Wrong Timing:**
   - Constraint validation runs BEFORE skill generation
   - YAML with constraints is generated LATER (line 2689)
   - Validation looks for constraints that don't exist yet

2. **Wrong Source:**
   - Looks in `requirements.description` (user's raw input)
   - Should look in generated skill YAML (after generation)

3. **Correct Flow Should Be:**
   ```
   Phase 0 → Categorization → Skill Generation (creates YAML + constraints)
                                         ↓
                              Validate constraints against power-up claims
                                         ↓
                              Final skill output
   ```

4. **Current Flow:**
   ```
   Phase 0 → Categorization → Constraint Validation (no constraints exist yet!)
                                         ↓
                              [User proceeds to skill generation]
                                         ↓
                              Skill Generation (creates YAML + constraints)
                                         ↓
                              Output (constraints never validated!)
   ```

**Root Cause:**
- **Architectural:** Constraint validation runs at wrong stage of pipeline
- **Context Isolation:** Validation doesn't have access to generated skill content
- **No Feedback Loop:** Generated constraints never validated against earlier claims

**Evidence in Code:**
- Constraint extraction: Lines 1846-1976
- Validation call: Line 2998 (too early in pipeline)
- Skill generation: Lines 2685+ (happens AFTER validation)

---

### Bug 3: Domain Pivoting in Problem Identifier

**Location in Code:** index.html lines 1655-1814

**Trace Through Code:**

**Step 1: Problem Identifier Input (line 1661-1664)**
```javascript
const domainContext = await extractDomainContext(requirements, utilityAnalysis.domain);
// domainContext contains:
// - primary_domain: "web research"
// - domain_practitioners: ["journalists", "researchers", "analysts"]
// - excluded_domains: ["investment research", "financial analysis", "M&A due diligence"]
```

**Domain Context IS Provided:** ✅
- Strong domain constraints
- List of practitioners
- Explicit excluded domains

**Step 2: Problem Identifier Prompt (line 1665-1784)**
```javascript
const prompt = `You are the Problem Identifier Agent for the ${domainContext.primary_domain} domain.

⚠️ CRITICAL CONSTRAINT - DOMAIN LOCK ⚠️
ALL problem identification and redesign suggestions must be grounded EXCLUSIVELY
in the ${domainContext.primary_domain} domain...

🚫 DO NOT PIVOT TO THESE UNRELATED DOMAINS:
${domainContext.excluded_domains.map(d => `- ${d}`).join('\n')}

2. CLAUDE CAPABILITY GAP (SPECIFIC TO ${domainContext.primary_domain.toUpperCase()})
   - What specifically can't Claude do well for ${domainContext.primary_domain}?
   - What would Claude need to do this?
`
```

**Domain Constraints:** ✅ Strong
**Capability Context:** ❌ Missing

**Step 3: The Bug Scenario**

**Input:**
- Domain: "web research"
- Practitioners: ["journalists", "researchers", "fact-checkers"]
- Excluded: ["investment research", "financial analysis"]

**Problem Identifier Thinks:**
1. "What can't Claude do for web research?"
2. **Without knowing Claude HAS web search** → assumes "Claude can't do web research"
3. Looks for problems where web research capability is needed
4. Sees "due diligence" as a research-heavy task
5. **Thinks:** "Due diligence needs research → web research is research → this fits!"
6. Suggests: "Investment analyst due diligence"
7. **Domain pivot!** Crossed from "web research" → "investment research"

**Why Domain Pivot Happens:**

**Factor 1: Missing Capability Context**
- Doesn't know: "Claude HAS web search capability"
- Thinks: "Claude needs web research added as a capability"
- Looks for: "Problems that need web research capability"
- Result: Finds problems in OTHER domains that need research

**Factor 2: Semantic Overlap**
- "web research" (the domain) ≈ "research" (the activity)
- Many domains need "research" activity
- Without clear capability baseline, agent pivots to any domain needing research

**Factor 3: No Capability Validation**
- Prompt asks: "What can't Claude do?"
- Doesn't provide: "What Claude CAN do"
- Agent may suggest adding capabilities Claude already has
- Or suggest capabilities Claude cannot have

**Step 4: Validation Attempt (line 1791-1808)**
```javascript
// Domain relevance validation
const validation = await validateDomainRelevance(
  domainContext.primary_domain,
  problemAnalysis,
  domainContext.domain_practitioners
);

if (validation.all_relevant) {
  addLog(`✓ All ${validation.total_suggestions} suggestions verified in-domain`, 'success');
} else {
  addLog(`⚠ ${validation.issues.length} domain pivoting issues detected`, 'warning');
  throw new Error('Domain pivoting detected');
}
```

**Validation Catches Some Cases:** ✅
- Post-hoc validation checks domain_relevance_score
- If suggestions score < 7, flags as domain pivot
- This is a SAFETY NET, not a prevention

**But Root Cause Remains:**
- Validation happens AFTER suggestions are made
- Better to prevent pivoting by providing correct context
- Missing capability context causes wrong suggestions in first place

**Root Cause:**
1. **Primary:** Problem Identifier lacks Claude capabilities context
   - Can't distinguish "Claude needs web search" vs "Claude has web search"
   - Suggests solutions for capabilities Claude already has
   - Suggests solutions across domains that share similar capability needs

2. **Secondary:** Asks agent to identify "gaps" without providing baseline
   - "What can't Claude do?" requires knowing "What CAN Claude do"
   - Without facts, agent guesses
   - Guesses lead to domain-crossing suggestions

**Based on FACTS or ASSUMPTIONS?**
- Domain constraints: ✅ **FACTS** (explicit excluded domains)
- Capability context: ❌ **ASSUMPTIONS** (agent must guess what Claude can do)

**Evidence in Code:**
- Problem Identifier prompt: Lines 1665-1784 (has domain context, lacks capability context)
- Capability gap question: Line 1696-1700 (asks what Claude can't do, doesn't say what Claude CAN do)
- Post-hoc validation: Lines 1791-1808 (safety net, not prevention)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Is Context Isolation the Issue?

**YES - Confirmed with Evidence**

### The Smoking Gun

**Evidence 1: Capabilities Exist in One Place Only**
```javascript
// index.html lines 1494-1498 (Categorization prompt ONLY)
CRITICAL CAPABILITY FACTS (October 2025):
✓ Claude HAS web search capability (launched March 2025)
✓ Claude Code CAN execute bash commands locally
✓ Claude Code CAN read/write files
✓ Claude Code CAN run scripts and commands
```

**Found in:** Categorization prompt (line 1494)
**NOT found in:** Phase 0 (line 1356), Problem Identifier (line 1665)

**Evidence 2: Phase 0 Has No Capability Context**
```javascript
// index.html lines 1356-1397 (Phase 0 prompt)
const prompt = `You are the Universal Utility Analyzer...

Evaluate this skill request using the three universal questions:

1. Can Claude already do this well from training data?
2. What specific value does this skill provide that Claude doesn't have?
```

**Asks about:** What Claude can/cannot do
**Provides:** Zero facts about Claude's capabilities
**Result:** Agent must guess

**Evidence 3: Problem Identifier Has No Capability Context**
```javascript
// index.html lines 1696-1700
2. CLAUDE CAPABILITY GAP (SPECIFIC TO ${domainContext.primary_domain.toUpperCase()})
   - What specifically can't Claude do well for ${domainContext.primary_domain}?
   - What would Claude need to do this?
```

**Asks about:** Claude's capability gaps
**Provides:** Zero facts about Claude's current capabilities
**Result:** Agent must guess what's missing

**Evidence 4: No Centralized Capabilities Constant**

**Search Results:**
```bash
grep -r "CLAUDE_CAPABILITIES" index.html  # ❌ Not found
grep -r "const.*capabilities" index.html   # ❌ Not found as shared constant
grep -r "claude.*capabilities" index.html  # ✓ Found only in prompts, not as data
```

**Conclusion:** No shared, reusable capabilities definition exists

### Checklist: Context Isolation Indicators

✅ **No centralized CLAUDE_CAPABILITIES document**
- Capabilities are hardcoded in one prompt only
- Not stored as a shared constant or configuration

✅ **Each phase makes independent assumptions**
- Phase 0: Guesses what Claude can do
- Categorization: Has explicit facts (but not shared)
- Problem Identifier: Guesses what Claude can do

✅ **Assumptions not based on verified facts**
- Phase 0 asks "Can Claude do this?" but provides no facts
- Problem Identifier asks "What can't Claude do?" but provides no baseline

✅ **Assumptions differ across phases**
- Phase 0: May think Claude lacks web search
- Categorization: Knows Claude has web search
- Result: Contradictory scores (9/10 → 2/10)

✅ **No validation that solutions match Claude's model**
- Problem Identifier suggests solutions without knowing Claude's constraints
- May suggest adding capabilities Claude already has
- May suggest capabilities Claude cannot have

✅ **Decision logic hardcoded, not parameterized**
- Capabilities hardcoded in Categorization prompt
- Not passed as parameters or shared context
- Changes require editing multiple prompts independently

### Why This Matters

**Impact on User Experience:**
1. **Confusing Score Changes**
   - "Your skill scored 9/10... wait, now it's 2/10"
   - No clear explanation why

2. **Incorrect Utility Assessments**
   - Skills for capabilities Claude already has score HIGH
   - Skills for real gaps score LOW

3. **Domain Pivoting**
   - Asks for web research skill
   - Gets suggestions for financial analysis
   - Caused by missing capability context

4. **Wasted Redesign Effort**
   - Suggests "add web search" when Claude has it
   - Suggests "add real-time data" when Claude can't have it
   - Redesigns don't align with Claude's actual model

**Impact on Code Maintenance:**
1. **Fragile Updates**
   - New Claude capability (e.g., image generation)
   - Must update Categorization prompt
   - BUT also need to update Phase 0, Problem Identifier
   - Easy to miss one, causing inconsistency

2. **No Single Source of Truth**
   - Can't easily answer: "What does the factory think Claude can do?"
   - Have to check each prompt individually
   - Different prompts may have different/outdated info

3. **Testing Difficulty**
   - Can't test "does factory use correct Claude capabilities"
   - Have to test each prompt independently
   - Inconsistencies only surface through manual testing

## Recommendations

### 1. Create Centralized CLAUDE_CAPABILITIES Context

**Create:** `claude-capabilities.js` or constant in `index.html`

```javascript
const CLAUDE_CAPABILITIES = {
  metadata: {
    last_updated: "2025-10-26",
    source: "Anthropic official documentation",
    environment: "Claude Code"
  },

  capabilities: {
    web_search: {
      available: true,
      launched: "March 2025",
      description: "Can search the web using WebSearch tool",
      examples: ["web research", "fact-checking", "current events"],
      use_cases: "Finding recent information, verifying facts, gathering sources"
    },

    bash_execution: {
      available: true,
      context: "Claude Code environment only",
      description: "Can execute bash commands locally",
      examples: ["file operations", "running scripts", "git commands"],
      limitations: "Local machine only, no remote server access"
    },

    file_operations: {
      available: true,
      operations: ["read", "write", "edit", "glob", "grep"],
      description: "Can read/write/edit files in local filesystem",
      limitations: "Local filesystem only, no remote storage"
    },

    real_time_data: {
      available: false,
      reason: "No live API access, database connections, or streaming",
      alternative: "Can provide frameworks/scripts for users to execute",
      examples_not_possible: ["live stock prices", "real-time inventory", "database queries"]
    },

    external_systems: {
      available: false,
      reason: "Cannot access external infrastructure or services",
      alternative: "Can provide deployment scripts and configurations",
      examples_not_possible: ["cloud deployment", "CI/CD execution", "database migrations"]
    },

    code_generation: {
      available: true,
      description: "Can generate code in any programming language",
      limitation: "Generated code, not executed external services"
    }
  },

  // Helper function to generate prompt context
  toPromptContext() {
    return `
CRITICAL CAPABILITY FACTS (Updated ${this.metadata.last_updated}):

WHAT CLAUDE CAN DO:
${Object.entries(this.capabilities)
  .filter(([_, cap]) => cap.available)
  .map(([key, cap]) => `✓ ${cap.description}`)
  .join('\n')}

WHAT CLAUDE CANNOT DO:
${Object.entries(this.capabilities)
  .filter(([_, cap]) => !cap.available)
  .map(([key, cap]) => `✗ ${cap.reason}${cap.alternative ? ` (Alternative: ${cap.alternative})` : ''}`)
  .join('\n')}
    `.trim();
  }
};
```

### 2. Inject Capabilities Context into All Phases

**Phase 0: Utility Analyzer**
```javascript
const prompt = `You are the Universal Utility Analyzer...

${CLAUDE_CAPABILITIES.toPromptContext()}

Now evaluate this skill request:
1. Can Claude already do this with its CURRENT capabilities (listed above)?
2. What specific value does this skill provide beyond Claude's current capabilities?
...
`;
```

**Problem Identifier**
```javascript
const prompt = `You are the Problem Identifier Agent for the ${domain} domain.

${CLAUDE_CAPABILITIES.toPromptContext()}

2. CLAUDE CAPABILITY GAP:
   - What does ${domain} need that Claude's CURRENT capabilities (listed above) don't provide?
   - Be specific: which capability from the list above is insufficient?
...
`;
```

### 3. Fix Constraint Validation Timing

**Current (WRONG):**
```javascript
// Line 2998 - Before skill generation
const validationResult = validateConstraints(requirements, utilityAnalysis);
// ❌ Constraints don't exist yet!
```

**Corrected Flow:**
```javascript
// After skill generation (around line 2800+)
async function generateSkill(requirements, research, analysis) {
  // Generate metadata (includes constraints)
  const metadata = await generateMetadata(requirements, research);

  // Generate documentation
  const docs = await generateDocumentation(requirements, research, metadata);

  // NOW validate: do constraints contradict power-up claims?
  const validationResult = validateConstraints(
    metadata, // ← Has YAML with constraints
    analysis.power_up_statement
  );

  if (validationResult.hasContradictions) {
    // Regenerate power_up_statement or adjust constraints
    // Or warn user about contradiction
  }

  return { metadata, docs, validation: validationResult };
}
```

### 4. Parameterize Category Definitions

**Create:** Shared category definitions

```javascript
const SKILL_CATEGORIES = {
  TEMPLATE: {
    max_utility: 3,
    description: "Code templates/examples",
    is_real_power_up: false,
    indicators: ["templates", "boilerplate", "scaffolding", "examples"],
    examples: ["API client framework", "project scaffolding"]
  },

  METHODOLOGY: {
    max_utility: 9,
    description: "Reasoning frameworks Claude applies",
    is_real_power_up: true,
    indicators: ["methodology", "framework for thinking", "systematic approach"],
    examples: ["contradiction detector", "research methodology"]
  },

  PROCESSOR: {
    max_utility: 9,
    description: "Processing/analysis logic Claude executes",
    is_real_power_up: true,
    indicators: ["analyzer", "detector", "researcher", "processor"],
    examples: ["web researcher", "fact checker", "data analyzer"],
    requires_capabilities: ["web_search", "bash_execution", "file_operations"]
  },

  EXECUTOR: {
    max_utility: 2,
    description: "External automation Claude cannot perform",
    is_real_power_up: false,
    indicators: ["deployment", "CI/CD", "cloud automation"],
    examples: ["cloud deployment", "database migration runner"],
    blocked_by_limitations: ["external_systems", "real_time_data"]
  }
};
```

**Use in prompts:**
```javascript
function buildCategorizationPrompt(capabilities, categories) {
  return `
${capabilities.toPromptContext()}

SKILL CATEGORIES:
${Object.entries(categories).map(([name, def]) => `
${name}:
- Max utility: ${def.max_utility}/10
- Description: ${def.description}
- Is real power-up: ${def.is_real_power_up}
- Examples: ${def.examples.join(', ')}
${def.requires_capabilities ? `- Requires: ${def.requires_capabilities.join(', ')}` : ''}
${def.blocked_by_limitations ? `- Blocked by: ${def.blocked_by_limitations.join(', ')}` : ''}
`).join('\n')}
  `;
}
```

### 5. Add Capability Validation to Problem Identifier

```javascript
async function analyzeProblem(requirements, utilityAnalysis, capabilities) {
  const prompt = `
${capabilities.toPromptContext()}

When suggesting redesigns:
1. Check: Does the suggestion require a capability Claude DOESN'T have?
   - If YES: Mark as "requires_external" and note which capability
2. Check: Does the suggestion use a capability Claude ALREADY has?
   - If YES: Explain how it builds on existing capability (not duplicating)
3. All suggestions must be achievable with Claude's CURRENT capabilities

For each suggestion, include:
{
  "capability_requirements": ["web_search", "bash_execution"],
  "capability_gaps": ["real_time_data"], // if any
  "achievability_score": 0-10, // 10 = fully achievable, 0 = requires unavailable capability
  "capability_validation": "explanation of why this is achievable with current capabilities"
}
  `;
}
```

### 6. Create Capability Change Management Process

**When Claude gains new capability:**

1. Update `CLAUDE_CAPABILITIES` constant
2. Add changelog entry
3. Run test suite to check impact on:
   - Phase 0 scoring
   - Categorization
   - Problem Identifier suggestions

**Example:**
```javascript
const CLAUDE_CAPABILITIES = {
  metadata: {
    changelog: [
      {
        date: "2025-03-15",
        capability: "web_search",
        change: "Added WebSearch tool",
        impact: "Web research skills now PROCESSOR (high utility), not EXECUTOR (low utility)"
      },
      {
        date: "2025-10-26",
        capability: "image_generation",
        change: "Added image generation capability",
        impact: "Image generation skills now PROCESSOR, not TEMPLATE"
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

## Questions for Clarification

### 1. Categorization Logic Intent

**Question:** For skills that use capabilities Claude ALREADY has (like web search), what should the utility score be?

**Current Ambiguity:**
- Categorization: "web researcher → PROCESSOR (max 9/10)"
  - Suggests it CAN be high utility
  - Even though Claude already has web search?

**Possible Interpretations:**
- **A:** Skill adds structure/methodology using existing capability → High utility OK
  - "Web researcher" adds research methodology, not web search capability itself
- **B:** Skill duplicates existing capability → Low utility
  - "Web researcher" redundant since Claude already has web search

**Recommendation Needed:**
- Clarify the philosophy: Skills that ORGANIZE/ENHANCE existing capabilities vs. ADD NEW capabilities
- Update prompts to be explicit about this distinction

### 2. Constraint Validation Scope

**Question:** Should constraint validation:
- **A:** Validate power-up claims don't contradict skill's documented limitations?
- **B:** Validate skill requirements don't contradict Claude's capabilities?
- **C:** Both?

**Current:** Only (A) - checks power-up claims vs. skill's own constraints

**Suggested:** Add (B) - validate skill requirements match Claude's capabilities
```javascript
function validateCapabilityRequirements(requirements, capabilities) {
  // Check: Does skill require capabilities Claude doesn't have?
  // Check: Does skill assume capabilities that are outdated?
}
```

### 3. Category Max Utility Caps

**Question:** Should category max utility be HARD CAPS or GUIDELINES?

**Current:** Hard caps (line 2960-2966)
```javascript
if (originalScore > categoryMaxUtility) {
  utilityAnalysis.utility_score = categoryMaxUtility; // Hard cap
}
```

**Alternative:** Use as guideline with explanation
```javascript
if (originalScore > categoryMaxUtility + 2) { // Only cap if significantly over
  // Log warning but don't cap
  // Require explanation for why it exceeds category typical max
}
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Hard cap: Prevents inflation, but may miss legitimately high-utility edge cases
- Guideline: Flexible, but allows score inflation

### 4. Multi-Phase Capability Updates

**Question:** When Claude gains a new capability (e.g., image generation), how should existing skills be re-evaluated?

**Scenarios:**
- User created "image-generator" skill when Claude couldn't generate images
  - Scored HIGH_UTILITY (added missing capability)
- Claude gains image generation
  - Should skill be re-scored as LOW_UTILITY (now redundant)?
  - Or remain HIGH_UTILITY (adds structure/methodology)?

**Recommendation Needed:**
- Versioning strategy for capabilities
- Migration path for skills when capabilities change

## Final Answer

### Does each phase make independent assumptions about Claude's capabilities, or is there a centralized context all phases use?

**Answer:** ✅ **Each phase makes INDEPENDENT assumptions.**

**Evidence:**
1. ❌ No centralized CLAUDE_CAPABILITIES document exists
2. ✅ Capabilities ARE documented, but ONLY in Categorization prompt (line 1494-1498)
3. ❌ Phase 0 does NOT have access to capabilities context
4. ❌ Problem Identifier does NOT have access to capabilities context
5. ✅ Each phase that needs capabilities must either:
   - Hardcode them (Categorization does this)
   - Guess them (Phase 0 and Problem Identifier do this)

**This IS a context isolation problem.**

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Create centralized `CLAUDE_CAPABILITIES` constant
2. Inject into all phase prompts
3. Fix constraint validation timing
4. Add capability validation to Problem Identifier
5. Establish capability change management process
